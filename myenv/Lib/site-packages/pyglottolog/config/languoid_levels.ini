# Glottolog distinguishes three levels of languoids:
# - family: any sub-grouping of languoids above the language level
# - language: defined as per
#   http://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation#inclusionexclusionoflanguages
# - dialect: any variety which is not a language

# The Glottolog classification imposes the following rules on the nesting of languoids:
# 1. Dialects must not be top-level nodes of the classification.
# 2. Dialects must not have a family as parent.
# 3. Languages must either be isolates (i.e. top-level nodes) or have a family as parent.
# 4. The levels of the languoids in a tree branch must be monotonically descending.

[family]
ordinal = 1
description = sub-grouping of languoids above the language level

[language]
ordinal = 2
description = defined by mutual non-intellegibility

[dialect]
ordinal = 3
description = any variety which is not a language
