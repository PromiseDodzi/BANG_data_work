The original questionnaire was in Chinese with no English translation. Later the STEDT project (:bib:Matisoff2015) digitized the data, translating Chinese concept labels to English, but not listing the original Chinese forms. As a result, some concept labels are identical, although they are different in the Chinese version. We are still trying to add the original Chinese concept labels to this resource, but for the moment, we only link the STEDT version, occasionally adding Chinese concept labels, where we figure they are important to distinguish the original meaning.
